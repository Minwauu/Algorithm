# Algorithm

## Properties of a good algorithm:

- clear and precisely stated steps that produce the correct output
- allow for invalid inputs
- must always terminate at some point
- should execute efficiently in as few steps as possible
- should be designed in such a way that other people will be able to understand it and modify it if necessary.
